### Start The Project

This can be done easily by running:

`npm i`

However, you may face an issue with the dependency `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` which is the enzyme adaptor for testing purposes. As their documentation says:

>>>enzyme's dependencies have not yet been updated to declare React 17 in peerDependencies. You need to add --legacy-peer-deps to the install command for it to work >>>correctly.
